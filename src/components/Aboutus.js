            <p style={{color:"warning"}}>The retail market in India has grown at a CAGR of 10 per cent-plus consistently in the past decade. The Covid-19 pandemic hit the sector financially, but it made businesses more resilient. Unlike the key players in the US like Walmart, the Indian market has a high number of retail players with the traditional unorganised segment forming the major chunk with 70 per cent-plus share. Consequently, the Indian market is highly competitive and dynamic in terms of technology, services, channels, and strategies.</p>
